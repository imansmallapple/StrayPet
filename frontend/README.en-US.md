- üöÄ **Cutting-edge Tech Stack** - React 19, TypeScript, Zustand, React-Router v7 and more latest technologies
- üì¶ **Out-of-the-box** - Integrated routing, state management, request encapsulation, code standards and complete solutions
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safety** - Complete TypeScript type definitions for code quality assurance
- üé® **Modern CSS** - SCSS preprocessing + BEM naming convention for standardized styling
- üîß **Engineering Standards** - ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, Commitlint and other code quality assurance tools

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/huangmingfu/react-ts-template.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd react-ts-template

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build:pro
```

## üß© Core Features

- **Route Lazy Loading**: Implemented route lazy loading to improve page switching performance and reduce initial loading time. (See `router`)
- **Route Guards**: Encapsulated flexible route guard management to ensure user access control and enhance application security. (See `router`)
- **Global State Management**: Provides Zustand global state management example code, simplifying cross-component state sharing and improving development efficiency. (See [store](./src/store))
- **Axios Request Encapsulation**: Encapsulated Axios to uniformly handle HTTP requests and responses, simplifying interaction with backend interfaces. (See [services](./src/services))
- **Utility Functions & Hooks**: Provides some convenient and practical utility functions and hooks. (See [utils](./src/utils), [hooks](./src/hooks))
- **react-dev-inspector Integration**: Click on page elements to open corresponding code in IDE, facilitating code debugging and improving development efficiency. (See [vite.config.ts](./vite.config.ts))
- **Automatic Import Order Beautification**: Integrated prettier-plugin-sort-imports plugin to automatically beautify import order, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Others**: Provides commands for convenient environment-based running and building; configured code splitting strategy; local reverse proxy for CORS; and detailed `nanny-level comments`, etc.

## üì¶ About Route Caching (keep-alive)

> React officially hasn't implemented functionality similar to Vue's \<keep-alive\>. React team rejected adding this feature based on two considerations, which you can search and read about. To achieve state preservation, the official team recommends these two manual state preservation methods:

- Lift the state of components needing state preservation to their parent components.
- Use CSS visible property to control the rendering of components needing state preservation, instead of using if/else, to prevent React from unmounting them.

> However, there are some libraries that implement this functionality, such as react-router-cache-route, react-activation, keepalive-for-react, etc. If your project needs to handle a small amount of state caching data, it's better to follow React's official recommendations and solve state caching issues manually.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

> 1. Currently, some UI libraries or third-party libraries do not yet support React 19. Please verify and choose appropriate versions for installation and usage.
> 2. This project does not use any features specific to version 19. If needed, you can directly downgrade to version 18 using the following command.

```bash
pnpm install react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1
```
